				<h1>Making Predictions from 2D Data</h1>
				<h3>Creating a model to predict vehicle MPG from horsepower.</h3>
				<p>
					This is a machine learning model built and trained using the
					TensorFlow Layers API to make predictions from a 2D dataset. In this
					demonstration I am using a small dataset and a simple (shallow) model.
					Given "horsepower" for a car, the model will learn to predict "Miles
					per Gallon" (MPG). Because we are training a model to predict
					continuous numbers, this task is sometimes referred to as a regression
					task. We will train the model by showing it many examples of inputs
					along with the correct output through a process called supervised
					learning.
				</p>
				<p class="p2">
					Vizualizing the data can give us a sense of whether there is any
					structure to the data that the model can learn. Using the TensorFlowJS
					visor we can use callbacks that we pass in to formulate graphs and
					scatterplots to visualize data. Given the visualization model to the
					right, we can see that there is a negative correlation between
					horsepower and MPG. As the horsepower increases, cars generally get
					fewer miles per gallon.
